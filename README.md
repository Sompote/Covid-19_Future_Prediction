# Covid-19_Future_Prediction
This project uses tensorflow.keras LSTM and Dense layers to create a Recurrent Neural Network to predict future 10 days of Covid-19 situation in Asia according to data form https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105613/covid19-new-daily-cases-worldwide-by-region/ 
The "linearregression.py" is used to create the RNN and train it.
The "Ready_to_Use.py" is used to predict for how many days you want throught the For loop.

Note: The future pridiction start after day 88.
